== Overview

The labs in this course cover many of the basic functions of Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM).
As you learned in the previous module, RHACM allows you to manage many Kubernetes clusters from a single location.
While the concept of a stretch cluster is something that is often requested, the complexity and potential problems that come with it due to conditions that are beyond the cluster's control--such as network latencies--usually outweigh the perceived benefits.
The preferred approach is multiple clusters--which can be large or small--that are centrally managed.
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management provides this functionality and more.

Within the RHACM web console, there are four main sections that you use to manage different aspects of your Kubernetes clusters and workloads.

Each of these sections is covered in a separate lab.
